      <txt><![CDATA[DATANUM identifies the particular sample from which the case is drawn in a given year. For most censuses, the IPUMS has multiple datasets available which were constructed using different sampling techniques (i.e. size/demographic of the sample population, geographic coverage level or location, or duration of the sampling period for the ACS/PRCS samples).

The 1970 samples present a special case; in addition to geographic coding differences, the samples were drawn from two distinct questionnaires ("long forms"), referred to in the IPUMS as Form 1 and Form 2. Different questions were asked of the persons in the Form 1 and Form 2 samples, necessitating separate treatment in the record layout. For other census years, DATANUM has a value of 1 because only one sample is available for that year.

The availability table for each variable indicates whether that variable is available in only certain samples for a given year. For further discussion of sample differences, see "Sample Designs." [URL omitted from DDI.]]]></txt>

      <labl>Household weight</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[HHWT indicates how many households in the U.S. population are represented by a given household in an IPUMS sample. 

It is generally a good idea to use HHWT when conducting a household-level analysis of any IPUMS sample. The use of HHWT is optional when analyzing one of the "flat" or unweighted IPUMS samples. Flat IPUMS samples include the 1% samples from 1850-1930, all samples from 1960, 1970, and 1980, the 1% unweighted samples from 1990 and 2000, the 10% 2010 sample, and any of the full count 100% census datasets. HHWT must be used to obtain nationally representative statistics for household-level analyses of any sample other than those.

Users should also be sure to select one person (e.g., PERNUM = 1) to represent the entire household.

For further explanation of the sample weights, see "Sample Designs" [URL omitted from DDI.] and "Sample Weights" [URL omitted from DDI.]. See also PERWT for a corresponding variable at the person level, and SLWT for a weight variable used with sample-line records in 1940 1% and 1950.]]></txt>
      <codInstr><![CDATA[
HHWT is a 6-digit numeric variable which indicates how many households in the U.S. population are represented by a given household in an IPUMS sample and has two implied decimals. For example, a HHWT value of 010461 should be interpreted as 104.61. HHWT specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below if applicable by Census year (and data sample if specified).

User Note: Users should also be sure to select one person (e.g., PERNUM = 1) to represent the entire household when using HHWT.

1. Northeast Region
New England Division: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont
Middle Atlantic Division: New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania 
2. Midwest (formerly North Central) Region
East North Central Division: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin
West North Central Division: Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota 
3. South Region

      <txt><![CDATA[STATEICP identifies the state in which the housing unit was located, using the coding scheme developed by the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). The ICPSR scheme orders states first by geographic division and then alphabetically within each division. Note that the ICPSR geographic divisions do not correspond exactly with the census regions used in the IPUMS variable REGION. 

State or territory names represent that state or territory's contemporary political boundaries for a given year. Users should familiarize themselves with any historical changes in these boundaries that might affect their research. (Go here [URL omitted from DDI.] for year-by-year maps of states and territories in the U.S.) IPUMS assigns current state codes to territories that later became states; for example, Arizona Territory in 1880 and 1900 is given the Arizona state code (61). In 1880, Dakota Territory counties are split between areas that ultimately became North and South Dakota.]]></txt>

In many public-use microdata samples, metropolitan and central/principal-city status are not directly identified. In such cases, IPUMS derives METRO codes based on other available geographic information, e.g., county groups (CNTYGP97 and CNTYGP98) or Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMA). If a county group or PUMA lies only partially within a metropolitan area or central/principal city, then METRO indicates that the status is "indeterminable (mixed)."]]></txt>

      <labl>Metropolitan area (2013 OMB delineations)</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[A metropolitan area, or metro area, is a region consisting of a large urban core together with surrounding communities that have a high degree of economic and social integration with the urban core.

MET2013 identifies metro areas of residence using the 2013 definitions for metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The 2013 MSAs are the first to be based on 2010 standards and 2010 census data.

MET2013 is available only for 2000 and later samples. Another variable, METAREA, identifies metro areas for earlier samples. Both variables are available for samples from 2000 through 2011. The Comparability section [URL omitted from DDI.] summarizes differences between the two variables.

Inexact Correspondence with Official Delineations
Since 1990, the only sub-state-level geographic information available in census PUMS data is for PUMAs, areas which occasionally straddle official metro area boundaries. Given this limitation, MET2013 cannot identify the exact set of households residing in each metro area.

The protocol used by MET2013 is to identify the metro area in which the majority of each PUMA's population resided. If MET2013 identifies a metro area for a given household, it indicates that, for the PUMA in which the household resided, a majority of the PUMA's 2010 population resided in the identified metro area.

Match Errors and Code Suppression
MET2013's code assignment protocol yields errors of omission (residents of a MSA who are not identified as residents) and errors of commission (non-residents who are identified as residents). PUMAs often nest well within metro area boundaries, resulting in small match errors, if any. For many metro areas, however, especially smaller metro areas, the intersecting PUMAs are a poor match.

As an index of mismatch, IPUMS uses the sum of percent omission error (the portion of an MSA's population residing in excluded PUMAs) and percent commission error (the portion of the population in associated PUMAs that did not reside in the MSA).

MET2013 reports no code for MSAs where the sum of match errors is 15% or more.

For each reported MET2013 code, the MET2013ERR variable identifies the level of the sum of errors. Researchers may use MET2013ERR to impose a more restrictive error limit if desired.

To compute match errors, IPUMS uses 2010 populations for ACS and PRCS samples and 2000 populations for 2000 samples. For samples that use 2000 PUMA definitions (which includes the 2000 samples and ACS and PRCS samples through 2011), IPUMS estimates the populations of the areas of intersection between 2000 PUMAs and 2013 MSAs by summing the populations of census blocks that had their geographic center in each area.

For more detailed information about PUMA-MSA relationships and MET2013 match errors, IPUMS provides these tables (in Excel spreadsheets):

      <txt><![CDATA[PUMA identifies the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) where the housing unit was located. In the 1990 State sample, PUMAs generally follow the boundaries of county groups, single counties, or census-defined "places". If these areas exceed 200,000 residents, they are divided into as many PUMAs of 100,000+ residents as possible. None of the 1990 State sample PUMAs cross state lines. For the 1990 Metro sample, PUMAs generally follow the boundaries of whole central cities, Metropolitan Statistical Areas, Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas, or non-metropolitan places (See METAREA for definitions of these terms). If these areas exceed 200,000 residents, they are divided into as many PUMAs of 100,000+ residents as possible. 1990 Metro sample PUMAs sometimes cross state lines; when they do, STATEFIP and STATEICP codes are not available for households in those PUMAs. PUMAs in the 2000 census, 2010 census, and the 2005-onward ACS/PRCS also consist of 100,000+ residents, and they do not cross state lines.

Note that PUMA is state-dependent. The codes must be read in combination with one of the STATE variables (STATEFIP or STATEICP). PUMAs are categorized by type (e.g., metropolitan, mixed metro/nonmetro, non-metropolitan) in the variable PUMATYPE. PUMA is similar to the county group variables, CNTYGP97 (1970) and CNTYGP98 (1980), and the State Economic Area variable (SEA) for 1940 and 1950.

Note Regarding Multi-Year Samples: The Census Bureau redraws PUMA boundaries every 10 years based on population information gathered from the most recent decennial census. ACS samples incorporate the new PUMAs within a few years of the Decennial Census. See the comparability statement to see which PUMAs are used in each sample. In Multi-Year ACS files, PUMA boundaries depend on the original year the respondent was interviewed (see MULTYEAR). For example in the 2010-2012 3-year ACS sample, respondents from 2010 and 2011 correspond to the Census 2000 based PUMAs, while respondents from 2012 correspond to the Census 2010 based PUMAs.]]></txt>

PUMA specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below by Census year (and data sample if specified).

User Note: PUMAs are drawn and coded differently for the 1990 State and Metro samples. In the 1990 State sample, PUMAs generally follow the boundaries of groups of counties, single counties, or census-defined "places". If such areas exceed 200,000 residents, they are divided into as many PUMAs of 100,000+ residents as possible. None of the 1990 State sample PUMAs cross state lines. In the 1990 Metro sample, PUMAs generally follow the boundaries of whole central cities, Metropolitan Statistical Areas, Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas, or non-metropolitan places (See METAREA for definitions of these terms). If these areas exceed 200,000 residents, they are divided into as many PUMAs of 100,000+ residents as possible. 1990 Metro sample PUMAs sometimes cross state lines; when they do, STATEFIP and STATEICP codes are not available for households in those PUMAs. PUMAs in the 2000 census, 2010 census, and the 2005-onward ACS/PRCS also consist of 100,000+ residents, and they do not cross state lines.

User Note: PUMA is state-dependent, therefore the codes must be read in combination with one of the STATE variables: STATEFIP or STATEICP.

User Note: In the 2006-2011 ACS, persons living in Louisiana PUMAs 01801, 01802, and 01905 were all coded as living in Louisiana PUMA 77777. This is because these three PUMAs no longer had sufficient population to be included as separate entities due the effects of hurricane Katrina.]]></codInstr>

      <labl>Group quarters status</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[GQ classifies all housing units as falling into one of three main categories: households, group quarters, or vacant units. It also identifies fragmentary sample units for 1850-1930 (see below). In all years, the data available about a person and their co-residents depend on whether the person lives in a household or in group quarters. Households are sampled as units, meaning that everyone in the household is included in the sample, and most household-level variables are available. People living in group quarters are generally sampled as individuals; other people in their unit may or may not be included in the sample, and there is no way of linking co-residents' records to one another. If, however, a sampled person in group quarters was living with relatives, the related group was sampled for 1850-1930. Most household-level variables are not available for group quarters or for vacant units.

Group quarters are largely institutions and other group living arrangements, such as rooming houses and military barracks. The definitions vary from year to year, but the pre-1940 samples have generally used a definition of group quarters that includes units with 10 or more individuals unrelated to the householder. See the comparability discussion below and "Sample Designs" [URL omitted from DDI.] for more details about changing definitions of group quarters.  Group-quarters types are identified in further detail by GQTYPE and GQFUNDS.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[PERWT indicates how many persons in the U.S. population are represented by a given person in an IPUMS sample. 

It is generally a good idea to use PERWT when conducting a person-level analysis of any IPUMS sample. The use of PERWT is optional when analyzing one of the "flat" or unweighted IPUMS samples. Flat IPUMS samples include the 1% samples from 1850-1930, all samples from 1960, 1970, and 1980, the 1% unweighted samples from 1990 and 2000, the 10% 2010 sample, and any of the full count 100% census datasets. PERWT must be used to obtain nationally representative statistics for person-level analyses of any sample other than those.

For further explanation of the sample weights, see "Sample Designs" [URL omitted from DDI.] and "Sample Weights" [URL omitted from DDI.]. See also HHWT for a corresponding variable at the household level, and SLWT for a weight variable used with sample-line records in 1940 and 1950.]]></txt>
      <codInstr><![CDATA[
PERWT is a 6-digit numeric variable which indicates how many persons in the U.S. population are represented by a given person in an IPUMS sample and has two implied decimals. For example, a PERWT value of 010461 should be interpreted as 104.61. PERWT specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below if applicable by Census year (and data sample if specified).

      <txt><![CDATA[RELATE describes an individual's relationship to the head of household or householder. Beginning in 1880, data on household relationship was asked of every person. The general relationship code is reasonably comparable across years. The detailed code makes distinctions that cannot be made in all years.

The relationship codes are divided into two categories: relatives (codes 1-10) and non-relatives (codes 11-13). In general, the codes for relatives are self-explanatory. The non-relative codes are divided into three groups: "Partner, Friend, Visitor," roughly described as persons who do not pay or work for their accommodations (unless they share ownership); "Other Non-Relatives," including those persons paying or working for accommodations; and "Institutional Inmates." See the comparability discussion for further information about the coding scheme.

RELATE is not available for 1850-1870, but the IPUMS variable IMPREL produces similar results.  As a convenience, the extract system is set up so that users may include RELATE in extracts of the 1850-1870 samples.

      <txt><![CDATA[With the exception of the 1970-1990 Puerto Rican censuses, RACE was asked of every person in all years. The concept of race has changed over the more than 150 years represented in the IPUMS. Currently, the Census Bureau and others consider race to be a sociopolitical construct, not a scientific or anthropological one. Many detailed RACE categories consist of national origin groups. Beginning in 2000, the race question changed substantially to allow respondents to report as many races as they felt necessary to describe themselves. In earlier years, only one race response was coded.

IPUMS offers several variables describing the answer(s) to the race question. RACE provides the full detail given by the respondent and/or released by the Census Bureau; it is not always historically compatible (see comparability discussion below). Users primarily interested in historical compatibility should consider using RACESING, and should consult the race code relationship page, Relationship between RACE and RACESING codes [URL omitted from DDI.], for detail about how the RACE and RACESING codes are related.

In addition, specific combinations of major races can be discerned using the following bivariate indicators of whether a particular race group was reported: RACAMIND, RACASIAN, RACBLK, RACOTHER, RACPACIS, and RACWHT. RACNUM indicates the total number of major race groups reported for an individual. The information contained in the bivariate indicators and in RACNUM is integrated into the detailed version of RACE. Users primarily interested in historical comparability should consider using RACESING and/or the accompanying variables PROBAI, PROBAPI, PROBBLK, PROBOTH, and PROBWHT.  Note that Hispanic origin is assessed through separate questioning (see HISPAN).

Prior to 1960, the census enumerator was responsible for categorizing persons and was not specifically instructed to ask the individual his or her race. In 1970 and later years, an individual's race was reported by someone in the household or group quarters. In the 1990 U.S. census, the 2000 U.S. and Puerto Rican censuses, the ACS, and the PRCS respondents were specifically asked what race the person "considers himself/herself" to be, although such self-description was more or less operative since 1960.

User Note: Race questions were not asked in the Puerto Rican censuses of 1970, 1980, and 1990.  They were asked in the 1910 and 1920 Puerto Rican censuses, the 2000-2010 Puerto Rican censuses, and the PRCS.]]></txt>

In 1920 (see the instructions to enumerators, below), foreign-born men age 21 and older and unmarried foreign-born women age 21 and older became naturalized citizens through their own efforts. Married foreign-born women achieved their naturalization when they married a native-born man or when their foreign-born husband was naturalized. Foreign-born children (under age 21) of foreign-born parents became naturalized when one of their parents was naturalized.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[YRIMMIG reports the year in which a foreign-born person entered the United States (or Puerto Rico, for the 1910 and 1920 Puerto Rico samples).   

For the 1900-1930 samples and the 2000-2004 ACS, YRIMMIG reports the exact year of immigration.   For 1970-1990, the respondent was asked to report the range of years that included their year of arrival.  For the 2000 census and the ACS from 2005 onward, exact years are reported back to 1935; some years prior to 1935 are collapsed into categories (see the codes page for details). The codes for all such categories represent the latest possible year in which a respondent could have immigrated.    

Other immigration variables are available; see the following table:

YRSUSA1 is a 2-digit numeric code reporting how long a person who was born in a foreign country or U.S. outlying area had been living in the United States. YRSUSA1 specific variable codes for missing, edited, or unidentified observations, observations not applicable (N/A), observations not in universe (NIU), top and bottom value coding, etc. are provided below if applicable by Census year (and data sample if specified).

YRSUSA1 Specific Variable Codes
00 = N/A or less than one year.

User Caution: Since the YRSUSA1 code 00 encompasses two meanings (N/A or less than one year), users who want to distinguish between the two need to interpret this code in conjunction with BPL as follows. For those with BPL less than 100 (born in the U.S.), YRSUSA1 = 00 means "N/A." For those with BPL code 100 or greater (born outside the U.S.), YRSUSA1 = 00 means "less than 1 year."]]></codInstr>

      <labl>Poverty status</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[POVERTY treats respondents who live in families collectively. It expresses each family's total income for the previous year as a percentage of the poverty thresholds established by the Social Security Administration in 1964 and subsequently revised in 1980, adjusted for inflation (see the poverty definition page [URL omitted from DDI.] for more information). POVERTY assigns all members of each family - not each household - the same code. POVERTY is also calculated for most adults living as unrelated individuals. For the 1950-2000 censuses, the reference period for income is the previous calendar year; for the ACS and the PRCS, the reference period is the preceding 12 months from the date of interview.

Whether an individual falls below the official "poverty line" depends not only on total family income, but also on the size of the family, the number of people in the family who are children, and the age of the householder (under/over age 65). POVERTY was created using detailed income and family structure information about each individual and calculating the family income as a percentage of the appropriate official poverty threshold. For example, if a person's family income is $20,000 and the poverty threshold for such a person is $13,861, then the value of POVERTY for that individual is $20,000/$13,861 * 100 percent, or 144. Individuals whose family income is more than five times the appropriate poverty threshold receive a POVERTY value of 501. For more detail on the precise poverty thresholds used for the POVERTY variable, see the poverty definition page [URL omitted from DDI.].

In POVERTY, the IPUMS evaluates poverty status individually for each distinct family unit in the household, as defined in FAMUNIT. For example, all persons related to the household head receive the same poverty value as the head, while an unrelated person and her child would share their own value distinct from that of the primary family. As mentioned in the FAMUNIT variable description, it is possible for individuals identified as being non-relatives of the head (RELATE) to be included in the primary family (FAMUNIT 1), based on family pointer information [URL omitted from DDI.]. However, because the POVERTY values for primary families in the 2000 Decennial and ACS/PRCS samples are published in the PUMS by the Census Bureau (see User Caution below) and the Census Bureau strictly excludes "non-relatives" (RELATED &gt; 1100) from primary families, some individuals identified as FAMUNIT 1 by IPUMS USA will not have the same POVERTY value as the head of household. These individuals will instead have the single-person poverty calculation assigned to them by the Census Bureau.

The original PUMS samples for years prior to 1990 did not include a poverty variable. Original PUMS samples from 1990 onward included poverty values, but IPUMS poverty values differ from the original PUMS values in a key way. The original PUMS samples treated all households members unrelated to the head as one-person families when assigning poverty values, even if such persons were part of a secondary family (i.e., persons living with their own relatives but not related to the household head). Thus, the original PUMS poverty measures do not account for the presence of children (or any other aspect of family size and composition) in secondary families. For example, in the original 1990 PUMS sample, a woman unrelated to the householder who has a child would receive a poverty value appropriate for a single person with a given income, rather than for a two-person family with a child. Consequently, the original PUMS samples from 1990 onwards tend to underestimate poverty. In the IPUMS, by contrast, the POVERTY value would be based on the threshold fitting the secondary family consisting of both the mother and the child. The IPUMS samples also round to the nearest poverty value, while the original census PUMS samples always round up.

User Caution: The incomes of the highest-earning individuals are "top-coded" in the 2000 census data, the ACS and the PRCS samples (see 2000 income Top codes [URL omitted from DDI.]). In the 2000-present period, for individuals in the first family unit of every household (cases where FAMUNIT=1), POVERTY uses the poverty values in the original PUMS samples, which are based on respondents' pre-top-coded income information. The POVERTY value for some of these cases will differ from calculations one could make by hand using the available information in the top-coded income variables. As noted above, the IPUMS calculates POVERTY values for members of secondary families, and these values are based on top-coded income information. (Like the ACS, the IPUMS also uses the income adjustment factor before calculating poverty, although use of this factor is not recommended with IPUMS data. See the ACS income standardization note [URL omitted from DDI.] for more information.) This variable also includes some valid values for group quarters (GQ) residents, even though the stated universe does not include such cases. Users who want to maintain a consistent universe should manually exclude group quarters residents.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[MIGRATE1 reports whether the person had changed residence since a reference point 1 year ago. Specifically, individuals age 1+ were asked if they had lived in the "same house" (non-movers) or a "different house" (movers) one year earlier. Persons who had moved were to indicate the foreign country or the state, county, and place of their normal residence during the reference year. Migration data were collected only for sample-line persons in 1950. 

The category "Same house" includes all eligible persons who did not move since the reference year, as well as those who had moved but by the enumeration or survey date had returned to their earlier residence. The category "Different house" includes persons who lived in a different house in the reference year. For 1950, movers (those who reported living in a different house in the reference year) are further subdivided according to type of move (e.g., within the county or across state lines). The ACS and the PRCS report only same/different residence and identifies those previously living abroad. 

Therefore, for the ACS/PRCS samples, MIGRATE1 uses information contained in the IPUMS variable  MIGPLAC1 and compatible PUMAs of migration and PUMAs of residence to indicate whether movers migrated between states or within the same state (the same levels of detail in the 1950 classification.). For movers who migrated between states, a detailed version of MIGRATE1 indicates whether they moved between contiguous or non-contiguous states. For movers who migrated within the same state, detailed MIGRATE1 indicates whether they moved within or between PUMAs.]]></txt>

      <labl>Migration status, 1 year [detailed version]</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[MIGRATE1 reports whether the person had changed residence since a reference point 1 year ago. Specifically, individuals age 1+ were asked if they had lived in the "same house" (non-movers) or a "different house" (movers) one year earlier. Persons who had moved were to indicate the foreign country or the state, county, and place of their normal residence during the reference year. Migration data were collected only for sample-line persons in 1950. 

The category "Same house" includes all eligible persons who did not move since the reference year, as well as those who had moved but by the enumeration or survey date had returned to their earlier residence. The category "Different house" includes persons who lived in a different house in the reference year. For 1950, movers (those who reported living in a different house in the reference year) are further subdivided according to type of move (e.g., within the county or across state lines). The ACS and the PRCS report only same/different residence and identifies those previously living abroad. 

Therefore, for the ACS/PRCS samples, MIGRATE1 uses information contained in the IPUMS variable  MIGPLAC1 and compatible PUMAs of migration and PUMAs of residence to indicate whether movers migrated between states or within the same state (the same levels of detail in the 1950 classification.). For movers who migrated between states, a detailed version of MIGRATE1 indicates whether they moved between contiguous or non-contiguous states. For movers who migrated within the same state, detailed MIGRATE1 indicates whether they moved within or between PUMAs.]]></txt>
