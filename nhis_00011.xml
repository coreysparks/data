      <txt><![CDATA[PERWEIGHT is an IPUMS NHIS-constructed variable based on the Final Annual Weight in the original NHIS public use files.  This weight should be used for many analyses at the person level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about all family members. PERWEIGHT represents the inverse probability of selection into the sample, adjusted for non-response with post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals. For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population.

There are instances, however, when the researcher should use a different person-level weight, particularly with supplements where a random adult or child family member was selected for questioning. For example, researchers analyzing variables from the sample adult/sample child supplements from 1997 forward should use SAMPWEIGHT rather than PERWEIGHT. 

Users  should review the documentation for extracted variables--most notably the "Weights" section toward the top of each variable description--to ascertain which weight is the appropriate choice for a given survey year.

      <txt><![CDATA[SAMPWEIGHT is an IPUMS NHIS-constructed variable that represents, with a few exceptions, the random selection of a sample person in the household to complete a supplement survey.  (The exceptions to this generalization are the 1983 health insurance supplement and 1993 health insurance, access to care, and family resources supplements, which were asked of all persons in the second half of the year.)

For survey years 1997 forward, SAMPWEIGHT is based on the Final Annual Sample Adult and Sample Child Weights in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used with variables taken from the sample adult or sample child supplements for 1997 on (as indicated by the supplement title in the "Source" section toward the top of each variable description). 

SAMPWEIGHT also contains the sampling weights for a subset of the pre-1997 supplements, for which the definition of a sample person, and the rules governing the section of sample persons, are less consistent. The universe statements for SAMPWEIGHT document who was included in the supplements requiring use of this weight on a year-by-year basis. SAMPWEIGHT consistently represents the inverse probability of selection into a supplement, adjusted for non-response with additional post-stratification adjustments for age, 
race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals.

Users  should review the documentation for extracted variables--most notably the "Weights" section toward the top of each variable description--to ascertain which weight is the appropriate choice for a given survey year. See the User Notes [URL omitted from DDI.] on the use of sampling weights for additional information.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[FWEIGHT is a variable based on the Final Annual Weight in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used for many analyses at the family level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about family characteristics. 


Creating FWEIGHT requires using independent estimates of the number of families from a reliable source such as the U.S. Census Bureau in order to perform post-stratification adjustments in a manner similar to what was done for the person-level weights. However, such independent estimates do not exist. 

As a result, the NHIS used the "principle person" method to create family-level weights. The person weight with the smallest ratio adjustment within each family was used as a proxy for the family-level ratio adjustment. This method is believed to provide a more accurate estimate of the total number of U.S. families than either the use of other person weights within the family or the use of no ratio adjustments at all. Therefore, the Family weight contains factors for selection probabilities at the household level, household non-response adjustment, and several ratio adjustment factors that are applied to all person weights.

      <txt><![CDATA[ASTATFLG identifies the record of a sample adult. A sample adult is the one adult per family who was selected at random by the computerized survey instrument to answer additional health-related questions, under the survey design instituted in 1997.  All persons other than sample adults (those not having the value 1 in ASTATFLG) are coded as "not in universe" for variables derived from the additional questions asked only of sample adults.  (Some additional questions were asked of both sample adults and sample children.)   Every adult in each family, except for active duty armed forces members, was eligible to be selected as the sample adult.  

ASTATFLG has the value "no one selected as sample adult" (code 4) for all adults in the family in the following two cases: 1) sample adult status was incorrectly assigned to someone in the armed forces, or 2) it could not be ascertained which adult in the family was chosen as sample adult.   

A similar flag variable, CSTATFLG, identifies the record of a sample child, that is, the one person under 18 per family who was selected at random for additional health-related questions, beginning in 1997, for families that included children.

This variable is automatically included in all extracts, but only has valid values for 1997 forward.]]></txt>

A sample child is the one person under age 18 per family who was selected at random by the computerized survey instrument for additional health-related questions, under the survey design instituted in 1997.  All persons other than sample children (those not having the value 1 in CSTATFLG) are coded as "not in universe" for variables derived from these additional questions asked only of sample children.  (Some additional questions were asked of both sample adults and sample children.)   

Every child in each family, except for active duty armed forces members and emancipated minors, was eligible to be selected as the sample child.  Emancipated minors are persons age 14 to 17 who are married or living with a partner OR who live on their own without the supervision of a parent, other adult family member, or legal guardian.  

CSTATFLG has the value "no one selected as sample child" (code 4) for all children in the family in the following two cases: 1) if sample child status was incorrectly assigned to someone who was ineligible, or 2) if it was unknown which child in the family was chosen as sample child.

A person may report his origin based on the origin of a parent, a grandparent, or some far-removed ancestor." The 1982 Field Representative's Manual noted, "There is no set rule as to how many generations are to be taken into account in determining origin."]]></txt>

In most cases, this information was collected via the question, "In what year did you come to the United States to stay?"  If the response to this question was "refused" or "don't know," the interviewer tried to collect the information via an alternatively phrased question: "About how long have you been in the United States?"   

The data included in the public use files for YRSINUS are recodes of the responses to these questions, with each answer in the form of a calendar year converted to a number of years present.  The calendar year format of the initial question would have increased the precision of responses by discouraging rounding; the recoded format (number of years present) is easier for researchers to analyze.]]></txt>

      <labl>Educational attainment</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[EDUC reports the highest level of schooling an individual had completed, in terms of completed grades for persons with less than a high school degree, and in terms of degrees attained for high school graduates and those with higher education.  Respondents were handed a card listing recognized categories and asked to identify the correct category.

According to the Field Representative's Manuals for 1997-2000, only "regular schooling which advances a person toward an elementary or high school diploma, or a college/university/professional school (such as law, medicine, dentistry)" counted as education.  Schooling in settings other than "regular schools" counted only if the credits obtained were acceptable in a regular school system.  Thus, for example, "adult education" classes not taken for credit or for the attainment of a college degree did not count.  

For the end of high school, EDUC distinguishes between those who completed twelfth grade but did not attain a diploma (e.g., those who failed to pass state-mandated high school exit examinations), those who graduated from high school, and those passed the GED (General Equivalence Degree) Test (which certifies that the test taker has attained high school-level academic skills).  Persons who attained a high school diploma in less than twelve years were to be recorded as "high school graduates," a guideline consistent with EDUC's emphasis on degrees attained rather than years spent in the classroom.  The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 directed interviewers to probe to determine whether persons who attended "post-graduate" high school classes but did not attend college had received a high school diploma.  

For nurses, interviewers were to determine whether training was received in a college or in a nursing school (with the grade completed at the last regular--non-nursing--school to be entered in the latter case).  For a person attending special education classes or a school for persons with mental, physical, or developmental difficulties, interviewers were to ask which grade in a regular school most closely matched the individual's education level.  Persons currently in school were generally assumed to have completed the previous grade.]]></txt>

      <labl>Body Mass Index, calculated from publicly released height and weight variables</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[BMICALC reports the Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women, as calculated by IPUMS NHIS from the public use file data on height and weight.  BMICALC was calculated using the following formula: [Weight in pounds/(Height in inches, squared)] multiplied by 703 and rounded to one digit past the implied decimal point.  Individuals not asked their weight and height are coded "000" (for "Not in universe") for BMICALC.   Individuals whose weight or height was topcoded, bottomcoded, or, for 1997 forward, an outlying value that was suppressed for confidentiality reasons, receive a code of "996" for BMICALC.

The website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on BMI reports the following "standard weight status categories associated with BMI ranges for adults."  BMI below 18.5 is associated with "underweight" weight status; BMI 18.5 to 24.9 is associated with "normal" weight status; BMI 25.0 to 29.9 is associated with "overweight" weight status; BMI 30.0 and above is associated with "obese" weight status.  


The CDC website also notes, "the correlation between the BMI number and body fatness is fairly strong; however, the correlation varies by sex, race, and age."  For example, women tend to have more body fat than men at the same BMI; older people, on average, tend to have more body fat than young adults; and highly trained athletes may have a high BMI because of increased muscularity rather than increased body fatness.  The CDC adds, "It is important to remember that BMI is only one factor related to risk for disease," and that other predictors, such as waist circumference and levels of blood pressure and physical activity, are also important.

      <labl>Cigarette smoking recode 2: Current detailed/former/never</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults 18 and over, this is a recoded variable indicating the respondent's current smoking status in categories of current smoker, every day current smoker, some day current smoker, current smoker--unknown frequency of smoking, and also indicates former smoker, never smoked and "has smoked, current smoking status unknown."


In this variable, current smokers were divided into "every day" smokers or "some days" smokers.  The process to classify respondents into these categories changed slightly between 1991 and 1992 forward.  In 1991, ever smokers were asked if they smoke now; respondents who said "yes" were asked if they smoked "every day" or "some days.  Respondents who answered "no" were asked, "Do you smoke some days or not at all?" This additional follow-up resulted in the classification of persons as "someday smokers" who would otherwise have been considered former smokers, since they initially said that they did not smoke now. 

In 1992, questions on smoking status were included in two sections of the survey; in the  Cancer Control section, the same three questions  from in the 1991 questionnaire were used;  in the Cancer Epidemiology section, just two questions were used: "Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes during your entire life?" If yes, "Do you NOW smoke cigarettes every day, some days, or not at all?" Use of both sets of questions allowed for estimation of the impact of the question change on population prevalence. The revised current smoking status question was estimated to have resulted in an increase in smoking prevalence of about 1 percent-- a result occurring mainly from capturing smoking among persons who would otherwise have been classified as nonsmokers with the original question.

This version of the question was used from 1992 forward.


Related Variables

Other recoded smoking status variables are included in the NHIS.


These include:
 
SMOKESTATUS1    "never," "current," "former," "former regular smoker," "former occasional smoker," "unknown," and unknown if ever smoked 100 cigarettes," and "smoked 100 cigarettes, unknown if currently smoke." 
SMOKESTATUS3  categorizes respondents into current every day smoker, current some day smoker ((1 or more days, past month),  current some day smoker  (0 days, past month), current some day smoker (unknown days in past month) and also indicates former smoker, never smoked and "has smoked, current smoking status unknown."

      <txt><![CDATA[MOD10FWK is a recoded variable created by the staff at the National Center for Health Statistics that draws upon the information in MOD10FTP (Frequency of moderate activity 10+ minutes: Time period) and MOD10FNO (Frequency of moderate activity 10+ minutes: Number of units) and reports the frequency of light or moderate leisure-time physical activities in terms of a single time unit, times per week.

Light or moderate activities are described in the survey question itself as activities that "cause only light sweating or a slight to moderate increase in breathing or heart rate."  The Field Representative's Manuals for 1997 forward provide examples of light or moderate leisure-time physical activities, although these examples were not routinely shared with respondents.  These examples include leisurely walking or bicycling, slow swimming or dancing, and simple gardening.

Vigorous leisure-time activities are described in the survey question itself as activities that "cause heavy sweating or large increases in breathing or heart rate."  The Field Representative's Manuals for 1997 forward provide examples of vigorous activities, although these examples were not routinely shared with respondents.  These examples include fast walking, fast bicycling, jogging, strenuous swimming or sports play, vigorous aerobic dance, and strenuous gardening.
